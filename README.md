# Web Development Fundamentals Project

A lot of people have been impacted by a difficult hiring market in the tech industry in 2022 and beyond.

Whether you're a new graduate from a college, university, or code school, or even self-taught, the inspiration of this project was to help each individual practice a core set of fundamental web development skills by building a single application.

## What this project is about:

The heart of this project is merely the implementation of a set of core skills that demonstrate your individual ability to build a web application with these fundamentals in mind.

It is a checklist of ideas for you to build into a project, which you can maintain over time. **It is tech stack agnostic** -- aside from some front-end skills like JavaScript and HTML, the list of skills must not include specific programming languages, frameworks, databases, etc.

I want this to be a community-driven effort to support one another. Encourage each other to keep going when you are feeling discouraged or stuck. Help each other get past any hurdles that are blocking your progress.

## What this is NOT:

I don't want this to become a gate-keeping list that we see so often, saying "you must know these 50 things or you are not a competent web developer."

I want to avoid to word "should": you "should" know this, you "should" be able to demonstrate this, you "should" be able to talk about this. Every company will have different skills for which they are interviewing. They will need some of these skills found in this project, and not need others. They may need skills not included in this project, but you can always add those things later.

This is NOT a project that I expect you'll put on a resume. You can certainly extend the project and use it as a launching point to start new projects if you choose. But if implemented as-is, probably will not look too fancy, and may feel disconnected in some ways.

## Pull requests welcome

I am very open to communication about things that the community would like to see on these lists, and alternate prioritization ideas.

# GOALS

**I want to help people get jobs.** Our tech industry is one where demonstration of your skill is a necessary portion of the interview process, as well as technical communication. By building this project, you will be better prepared to execute ideas in technical challenges and take-home assignments from companies, and speak to the purpose of each of these skills as a web developer.

**Practice Makes Better.** Building this project will allow you to practice these fundamental skills in a single environment, instead of having a number of projects (or smaller personal involvement in larger projects) trying to showcase these skills.

**Self-paced, no deadlines.** Building this application quickly won't guarantee you a job any more than working at it more methodically and carefully. However, you will prioritize working on this project in a way that represents your urgency of finding a new job.

# The Fundamentals

(last updated February 3, 2023)

These fundamental skills are broken down first by job role, and then by "core skills" and "nice to have" skills. They are prioritized by the community and ideally added to your application in this order. Ultimately, this is YOUR project to implement, so build it however you feel makes sense to you, or to highlight the kinds of skills YOU want to present to a hiring company.


## Front-end Development

A front-end developer deals with user interactions, user interface controls, and the overall "experience" of the application. 

#### Core Skills:

- understanding of Framework / components / routing
- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS and data presentation
- event handling
- form processing (building form, browser-side validation)
- async data fetching
- parsing complex data payloads
- authentication

#### Nice-to-have Skills:
- Web security topics (OWASP Top Ten) which are applicable to front-end, such as protecting against click-jacking or cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.
- Behavior-driven or Test-driven development

## Back-end Development

Back-end development is more "behind the scenes" work, and processing of data, with less direct user interaction. A typical back-end developer will be storing and retrieving data in some sort of database, or getting and transforming data to or from a third-party API service.

#### Core Skills:
- MVC design pattern in your framework of choice
- form processing (CRUD)
- ORM for storing/retrieving data from a database
- building REST API endpoints
- handling authentication requests (who is this user)
- determining authorization access (what are they allowed to do)
- consume a 3rd party REST API
- parsing complex data payloads

#### Nice-to-have Skills:
- Web security topics (OWASP Top Ten) especially around data handling, and user access controls
- OAuth (do something on behalf of the user)
- Test-driven development, maybe some behavior-driven development

## Full-stack Development

Full-stack development is a good overlap of front-end and back-end development. Notice that this is not a full, combined list of EVERY skill listed above for front-end and back-end development, but rather a subset of what the community has determined is "enough" to know for a full-stack developer. Certainly, the more of these skills you incorporate the more value you bring to a company, but implementing ONLY these ideas is enough to start a full-stack developer role.

#### Core Skills:
- MVC design pattern or framework concepts (components/routing)
- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS
- form processing (building form, browser-side validation)
- form processing (CRUD operations)
- ORM for storing/retrieving data
- handling authentication requests (who is this user)
- determining authorization access (what are they allowed to do)
- consume 3rd party REST API

#### Nice-to-have Skills:
- web security topics (OWASP Top Ten)
- both Behavior-driven and Test-driven development

# Community and Accountability

I have two goals in mind for community, and must conform to an agreed-upon set of community behavior guidelines for conduct.

1. **A regular check-in of some kind: with each other, and with mentors.**
    - For the "with each other" check-in, it doesn't have to be a daily stand-up, but the community needs a place where people feel comfortable talking and sharing their progress or where they're stuck. Hold each other accountable, form smaller accountability teams where you'll notice if someone is NOT there or not making progress. Talk about where you're stuck, ask for helpe.
    - For meeting with mentors, ideally a weekly 1-hour or 2-hour public "office hours" session where mentors can facilitate help at a high level. (not all mentors will necessarily have experience with the tech stack you choose) Mentors have some amount of professional development experience in the workplace. (at least 2 years, ideally 4+ years)
    - Regular "be proud of your work" demo time. Perhaps this is part of the mentor office hours where the call begins with demonstrating some portion of your project. It is important that this doesn't become a showcase of how quickly someone can code, or how brilliantly someone designed an interface, or this will discourage others from making progress. There's a difference between being proud of your work, and showing off.

2. **Group Communition, but Solo Execution.** While it's imperative to have community help when you get stuck, it's important that YOU are the one writing the code, not just copying/pasting snippets of code from sources you find online.
    - Pair programming is helpful and encouraged, as long as someone else is not contributing code directly to your project.
    - Individuals openly share their code, and their progress, publically. Posting on social media is a great way to start, and community members can help support those posts with likes, comments, etc..

## Public accountability

People who write about their progress on a regular basis may find networking with other professionals a little easier. If you can get commynity members to re-share your post, or even just to like it, comment on it, etc, it will promote your post to other peoples' timelines, increasing the exposure of your work.

**Important: Do NOT write your progress as a series of "how-to" articles.** These kinds of posts quickly go out of date, and you will get more negative responses about how that wasn't the "correct" way to do something.

Instead, post TWICE PER WEEK on your platform of choice which includes a brief summary of your progress.

The very first post will contain the following:
- that you're working on a new project
- please link to this repo :)
- mention the frequency/cadence of how often you'll post about your progress
- ask for encouragement and to like/reshare your content -- be SHAMELESS about this, people are less likely to do it if you don't ask for it

> I am starting to work on a new project which showcases my knowledge of web development fundamentals. I'm following a guide found at https://tig.fyi/project and will be posting notes about my progress every Monday and Thursday until I finish, or until I find a new job, whichever comes first. I would love any encouragement from my network. Please add a like to this post to help others in your network see that I'm looking for a new job.

After that, your regular posts can look like this:

> Over the last few days, I implemented ORM functionality into my ongoing project to save/retrieve data from a MySQL database. I had trouble getting MySQL installed, but I found a great guide at http://blahblahblah.com that helped. Next, I'll be adding some user roles to implement authentication and authorization! Please add a comment below about what you think of my progress! If you want to see my commit history, check out my repo at ...

## Group accountability and communication

The community needs a place to chat about progress, ask questions about getting started, find help, and to find an accountability team.

To start, we'll be using a new private channel on Turing's slack channel, but ultimately I think we'll need a community Discord server to handle long-term help and chat history, have regular voice/video channels available, and be open to more than just Turing's community.

## Sponsorship & Community Involvement

Project was brainstormed and kicked off by [Ian Douglas](https://linkedin.com/in/iandouglas736), a long-time tech industry professional programmer and educator. Ian [live-streams on Twitch](https://tig.fyi/live) about career advancement and interview preparation, and has a lot of [free content online](https://techinterview.guide) and on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/iandouglas). Ian first started working on this project outline idea as part of his job coaching in late 2021.

Efforts to launch this project idea began with staff and students from [The Turing School of Software & Design](https://tuirng.edu) in January and February 2023.

Ultimately, the goal of this project is to reach beyond Turing and serve a wider community where we can rally around one another for support and encouragement.
